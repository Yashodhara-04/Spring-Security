## Introduction

Created a Spring Security project to gain hands-on experience with authentication in a Spring Boot application. This project will help understand the internal workings of Spring Security and how to customize it for specific security needs.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implemented secure user login with password encryption using Spring Securityâ€™s authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Management:** Replaced traditional session management with stateless JWT token-based authentication.
- **CSRF Protection:** Disabled CSRF protection for stateless JWT authentication, ensuring secure API communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** For building the core application.
- **Spring Security:** To implement authentication, authorization, and access control.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** For stateless user authentication and authorization.
- **Java:** The primary programming language for the project.
- **Maven:** For project management and dependency management.
- **MySQL:** For storing user data (depending on the database used).

  ## Usage

**1. Run Application**
   - Run the project.
     
  ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

**2. Save Username and Password**
  - Save Username and Password for login.
  ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/User
   ```
  ```bash
   {
    "id":   1,
    "username": "SpringSecurity",
    "password": "sp@123"
   }
   ```

**4. Login API**
   - Call Login API that sets security context and returns JWT token.
  ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/login
   ```
  ```bash
   {
    "username": "SpringSecurity",
    "password": "sp@123"
  }
   ```

**5. Student API**
   - Call the Student API by passing the obtained JWT token to test authorization.
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8080/students
   ```
